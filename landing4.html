										In the first version I lead my group to create the "weight discrepancy controller" everything went according to plan and we completed the code on time. However as a group we only left a short period of time for testing me and a few others assisted the testing group and managed to get pretty close to full coverage in a day but had very close call on the submission.
									</p><p>
										In the second version I became the leader of the testing group and worked on creating tests preemptively. This allowed the testing group to finish with extra time on our hands. However when merging a lot of issues occurred as multiple groups worked on the same files within their branches causing a large amount of conflicts. I worked with a few members to resolve this conflict but it resulted in yet another nail biting submission 1 hour before deadline.
									</p><p>
										For the final version I have been elected as a secondary leader of the assignment and will be focusing on coordinating groups and preventing major merge conflicts or timing issues from arising, as well a my role of tester. I also have groups working in closer touch with there testers so that the tester can help and also has a better understanding of the code base.
									</p><p>
										In this project while mistakes were made I was always will willing to step up and help resolve the problem in the immediate and also took on roles to prevent the problem in the future. A combination of my leadership and willingness to step up when its needed is a key pillar of my groups organization and success.

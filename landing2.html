									<p>In this assignment I took a leadership role in the division of labor, deciding how the diagrams would be separated as there were 5 of varied difficulties and only 4 members in the group. After that I made the state machine and one of the sequence diagrams, before the group met back and reviewed each others work and asked questions. I am quite happy with how the division of work was done with 2 of us doing 2 diagrams and 2 of us working together on the much larger structure diagram. However during planning I was slightly ambitious with our in group planning setting the deadline for the diagrams to be the end of Friday, however consistent progress updates allowed us to shift that to Sunday morning which was needed for all members as deadlines were particularly tight.

										I am relatively proud of the work done as well, when doing my work and checking others, requirements outlined in lectures were consulted through rereading notes or rewatching entire lectures. Finally there were multiple points where we could not figure out what level of detail to use and had to make what we believed to be the best decision. During such discussions I was vocal but definitely allowed others to air their ideas and on quite a few occasions in this assignment I conceded after hearing there reasoning.
										
										I am quite happy with this assignment as well and once again took a somewhat leadership role, however left a lot more to groupmates to deal with time constraints and due to my confidence developed in them in the first assignment.</p>

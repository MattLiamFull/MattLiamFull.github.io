									<p>Was the primary voice in discussion and came with meeting plans prepared as I led the group from one problem to another. Work was often done together instead of divided as decision making was a major part of the assignment. To keep the process moving I was often the one to present an option to the group for deliberation. When work was divided and assigned I always completed it before the deadline. <br><br> One issue with my and our group's approach was the time commitment, while I am quite happy with the final product, getting there took quite a long time. Because most work was done together the project took longer than expected which was fine as it was early in the term however if I was to redo this assignment I would divide slightly more work to keep everyone's schedules balanced.</p>

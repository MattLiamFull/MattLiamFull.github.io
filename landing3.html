										<h2>My work on the project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In this assignment I had a house move in the days leading up to the due date which would leave me with inconsistent Wi-Fi, communication, and time. As I had taken a leadership role in the past two assignments I made this very clear and handed the leadership role to the best fit within the group. Once work was divided I burned the midnight oil in a hotel to make sure that my part was complete before the first major drop-off of communication with my group (as I had no wifi and cell). I was quite happy with how my work turned out in this assignment and was able to find time to help the others through discord messages near the end of the project.
									</p><p>
										In this project I showed maturity and responsibility in identifying a upcoming issue and creating the ground work for it to be overcome while still doing good work for my group.</p>
